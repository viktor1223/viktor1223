## Hi there 👋

I’m Viktor, an **AI researcher** working on a project that uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to help **educators identify knowledge gaps** in student coursework. The goal of this work is to **reduce skill erosion** in the **intelligence age** by empowering teachers to provide **personalized education** that adapts to the unique needs of each student.

🌱 **Current Project:**  
My project focuses on harnessing **LLMs** to provide **actionable insights** for educators, helping them detect where students might be struggling and offering ways to tailor their instruction. By addressing these **knowledge gaps**, we can support students in keeping pace with the rapid changes in technology and ensure they’re equipped for the future.

🔬 **Past Work:**  
Before diving into this venture, I worked on **perception models** for **self-driving vehicles**, and I’ve also been involved in **bias reduction** within **pre-trained models** and **ADAS**. Now, I’m focusing entirely on **educational technology** and how AI can improve **learning outcomes**.

🤝 **Let’s Collaborate:**  
If you’re interested in **AI-powered education** or have ideas for how to make **learning more personalized**, I’d love to connect. I’m always open to discussing how we can work together to make a meaningful impact on **education in the AI age**.

📫 **How to reach me:**  
Feel free to reach out through GitHub or drop me a message to discuss anything related to **AI** and **education technology**.

⚡ **Fun Fact:**  
I believe that **maximizing learning and growth** is the key to **maximizing both impact and happiness**.
