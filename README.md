## Hi there 👋

I’m Viktor, an **LLM & CV researcher** who took an unconventional path by **dropping out of a PhD** to pursue a research career in the industry. I began my AI journey in **2017**, researching **perception models** for **self-driving vehicles** before transitioning to focus on **bias reduction** in **pre-trained models**. Over the years, I’ve worked on **ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems)** and **LLMs (Large Language Models)**, aiming to make meaningful impacts in AI across different domains.

💻 **Current Venture:**  
I’m currently researching how we can leverage **LLMs** to identify **knowledge gaps** in **student coursework**. The goal is to help **teachers develop more individualized education** and address **skill erosion** in the **AI age** by enhancing the learning process.

🔬 **Past Work:**  
- **Perception models for self-driving vehicles** 
- Focused on **bias reduction** in **pre-trained models**, working on **ADAS** and **LLMs**.
- Developed tools and research aimed at improving AI fairness and performance in real-world applications.

🌱 **Learning & Growing:**  
I’m always striving to push the boundaries of **AI research** and **education technology**, specifically in how **AI can help individuals learn** and grow, while ensuring that **bias reduction** is a key consideration in all models.

🤝 **Let’s Collaborate:**  
I’m always interested in collaborating with others who are passionate about using AI to drive **positive societal impact**, whether it’s in **education**, **automated systems**, or **machine learning fairness**.

📫 **How to reach me:**  
Feel free to reach out through GitHub issues, or drop me a message if you'd like to discuss AI, LLMs, or education technology.

⚡ **Fun Fact:**  
I believe that **maximizing learning and growth** is the key to **maximizing both impact and happiness**.
